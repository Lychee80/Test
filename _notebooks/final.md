# Final Collegeboard

## Question 7 
I didn't read the question carefully and didn't notice that the new Person object was called student and so we should be referring to student when setting the name

## Question 40 
I was kinda confused about what the question was asking for but it makes a lot more sense after reading the answer

## Test Reflection

I think I need to study Java a lot more since I needed to search up a lot of things when taking this test. I was confused about a lot of questions which kinda shows that I still have room to grow and learn. Some of the parts that I really needed to work on is arrays since this is a big part of the test and it made up a majority of the questions. I was confused a lot on the looping through an array part and had to get help. Another thing that I got really confused about was the substrings and this I had to get help. I'm still a bit lost about substrings so this is one of the things I need to work on. 

## Trimester Reflection

I think this trimester I had a lot of problems with time management and this kind of impacted my work in this class and just in school in general and so moving forward this is something I really want to work on. I also felt that it was kind of rough for me too since I went into this class not really knowing much and having not taking CSP beforehand and with little experience and I think that I kind of overestimated myself and so next trimester I think I really need work harder in order to make up for some parts of knowledge that I just lacked. However, overall this trimester was a really fun experience and I learned a lot through just being uncomfortable and going through things that I just didn't know.
