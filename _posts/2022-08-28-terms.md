  - > Diction is effective it is specific, appropriate, and leads to imagery ( don’t use popularly used phrases, use own words to describe ex testing the water)

  - > Formal to informal: learned, popular, colloquial, slang

  - > Don’t have jargon ( wordy and abstract- high diction, passive voice)

  - > paragraphs (unity- one idea, complete-just right amount of info, order, coherence)

  - > TS last or first

  - > Order in paragraphs: specific to general, general to specific, whole to part, ? to answer, effect to cause

  - > Coherence through repetition, contrast, transitions ( for, in addition, etc), connect between paragraphs

  - > Intro - statement, info/stats, quotes, dramatic, story

  - > Ending- restate/emphasize, predict, resolve, quote

  - > Sentence combination
    
      - > Sentence modification- context/purpose, important details,
    
      - > Sentence coordination- use same idea
    
      - > Subordination - combine sentences as a phrase/clause
